# Simple Banking System in Java
A lightweight command-line project that simulates basic banking functionalities. Crafted with simplicity in mind, it serves as a foundational project for banking operation simulations.

## Features
Interactive Interface: Utilizes Java's Scanner class for interactive command-line inputs.
Account Creation: Create a new account to get started.
Balance Inquiry: Check the current balance anytime.
Deposit: Add money to your account.
Withdrawal: Withdraw money and see the remaining balance.
Transaction History (Coming Soon): View all your past transactions at a glance.

## Upcoming Enhancements
Spring Boot Integration: In the near future, this project will be enhanced with Spring Boot to introduce HTTP requests. This will bring more realism and sophistication to the banking simulation by emulating web-based banking services.
